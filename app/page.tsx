          I spend most of my time as a frontend developer, but I also have experience with backend.
          Sometimes I use Node.js, Docker and Java and
          I&apos;m currently trying some wizardry in TypeScript ðŸª„.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          Outside of work I spend my time learning new techs as the industry never stops evolving,
          I also go to the gym, enjoy some nighttime gaming and like to spend time outdoors.
